  <p>My name is Melanie Segovia and I'm 17 years old turning 18 next month!!! :)) I'm the oldest of 3 siblings and I have 5 dogs who I love very much (there annoying)!!! I was born in Ventura but rasied in Oxnard and moved to Shafter during my freshman year. My favorite hobbies are sewing, reading, and drawing!!! My favoirte season is Fall, I love how the way the leaves look and it's also when it rains a lot which I love the rain!!! Fun fact my last name is named after a city in Spain as well as a castle in Spain that Disney was inspired to draw for Cinderella's castle.     <p>
